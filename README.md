# mlex_data_clinic

## Description
This app provides a training/testing platform for latent space exploration with
unsupervised deep-learning approaches.

## Running as a Standalone Application (Using Docker)

The **Prefect server, Tiled server, the application, and the Prefect worker job** all run within a **single Docker container**. This eliminates the need to start the servers separately.

However, the **Prefect worker** must be run separately on your local machine (refer to step 5).

## Steps to Run the Application

### 1 Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_data_clinic.git
cd mlex_data_clinic
```

### 2 Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then **update the** `.env` file with the correct values.

**Important Note:** Due to the current tiled configuration, ensure that the `WRITE_DIR` is a subdirectory of the `READ_DIR` if the same tiled server is used for both reading data and writing results.

### 3 Build and Start the Application

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

* `-d` â†’ Runs the containers in the background (detached mode).

### 4 Verify Running Containers

```sh
docker ps
```

### 5 Start a Prefect Worker

Open another terminal and start a Prefect worker. Refer to [mlex_prefect_worker](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_prefect_worker) for detailed instructions on setting up and running the worker.


### 6 Access the Application

Once the container is running, open your browser and visit:
* **Dash app:** http://localhost:8072/

### 7 Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the running containers, use:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This will **shut down all services** but **retain data** if volumes are used.


## Model Description
**pytorch_autoencoder:** User-defined autoencoders implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

Further information can be found in [mlex_pytorch_autoencoders](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_pytorch_autoencoders/tree/main).

## Developer Setup
If you are developing this library, there are a few things to note.

1. Install development dependencies:

```
pip install .
pip install ".[dev]"
```

2. Install pre-commit
This step will setup the pre-commit package. After this, commits will get run against flake8, black, isort.

```
pre-commit install
```

3. (Optional) If you want to check what pre-commit would do before commiting, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. To run test cases:

```
python -m pytest
```
